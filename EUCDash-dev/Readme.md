This version requires the TTGO_TWatch_Library https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library
However LVGL must be updated.
- Get the latest version via the Manage Libraries in Arduino
- Find the location if the library, replace the src directory: <arduino user library location>\TTGO_TWatch_Library-master\src\lvgl\src with the src directory from the new LVGL library
